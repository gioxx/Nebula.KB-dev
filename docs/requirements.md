## PowerShell Version

Nebula modules are compatible with Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell (Core) 7.4+.

## .NET Framework Version

Nebula modules require .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later.

## Windows Client

### Currently Supported

Nebula modules were developed primarily on the most recent version of Windows (currently Windows 11). Considering that the first versions of what is now Nebula.Core were developed with Windows 10 (version 1703), it can be said that the modules are currently compatible with the [Windows Client versions currently supported by Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/supported-versions-windows-client), although I personally do not recommend using it on older versions.

#### Windows 11
- Windows 11 25H2
- Windows 11 24H2
- Windows 11 23H2
- Windows 11 22H2
- Windows 11 21H2

#### Windows 10
- Windows 10 22H2
- Windows 10 21H2

## Windows Server

Some of the features contained in the Nebula modules are used daily in Windows Server environments. Compatibility has also been verified on these versions of the Microsoft operating system.

### Currently Supported
- Windows Server 2025
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019 (version 1809+)
- Windows Server 2016 (version 1607+)
