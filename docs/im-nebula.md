## Introduction to Nebula Modules

Nebula modules simplify some of the daily operations involved in interfacing with Microsoft 365 and products within the Microsoft Cloud ecosystem. They provide a set of well-defined functions for common tasks involving Microsoft Exchange (in the Cloud), Entra, and Intune.

The purpose of this documentation is to gather information about the features and benefits of Nebula modules for PowerShell, system requirements, and support under one roof. It also includes some other utilities related to other works published in the PowerShell Gallery (scripts, utilities directly available via browser, etc.).

## Contributing

**Nebula.Core** and, in general, every Nebula module is an open source project based on the MIT license ([`LICENSE`](https://github.com/gioxx/Nebula.Core/blob/main/LICENSE)). The main project, as well as the documentation and all related tools, are available on GitHub: [Nebula's repositories](https://github.com/gioxx?tab=repositories&q=Nebula).

All Nebula modules are open to code contributions, including feature requests, bug reports, and pull requests.

## Support

All Nebula modules are offered free of charge and as open source to users who wish to use them. If you encounter any problems or have any questions, the [GitHub repositories for the individual modules](https://github.com/gioxx?tab=repositories&q=Nebula) are good places to go for help.  
There is no preferential support channel and/or dedicated commercial support channel at this time, nor are there any plans to create one, at least for now.

## Something missing?

If you encounter problems in the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please [report the issue](https://github.com/gioxx/Nebula.KB/issues/new/choose).
