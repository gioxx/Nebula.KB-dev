# Projects overview

This area hosts documentation for small, self-contained projects that live outside the Nebula PowerShell modules. Often, though, they’re still projects connected to the Microsoft 365 world.  
Each page focuses on how to run, deploy, and integrate a specific tool.

:::note Work in Progress 🚧
More projects will be added here as soon as their documentation is ready.  
**Remember**: many of the projects available on GitHub, but not yet documented in this KB, often already have a `README.md` file that explains everything you need to know.
